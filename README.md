# Tower-Defense-3D

This is a Unity project written in Visual Studio and C#.  I've always loved Tower Defense games, and it's time to make a 3D version in a modern platform.  I will attempt to add in all my favorite features.


note: wheel scrolling doesn't work by default on the webGL build, so a scruot needs to be ammended to the browser html, per this article:

I'll see if I can add a UI zoom feature (or maybe shift?)
